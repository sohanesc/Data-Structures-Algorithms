Big O notation is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the complexity of an algorithm. It's a
way to describe how long an algorithm takes to complete, relative to the size of the input.

**What does it mean?**

In simple terms, Big O notation tells you how many steps (or operations) an algorithm requires to complete its
task as the input size increases. This is usually measured in terms of time complexity, although sometimes space
complexity is also considered.

Here are some key points about Big O notation:

1. **Asymptotic behavior**: Big O notation looks at the worst-case scenario for an algorithm's performance,
ignoring minor variations.
2. **Input size**: The input size is typically represented as `n`, where `n` is a positive integer (e.g., number
of elements in a list).
3. **Operations**: Each operation performed by the algorithm is counted, such as arithmetic operations,
comparisons, or data accesses.

**Common Big O notations**

1. **O(1)**: Constant time complexity - The algorithm's performance doesn't change with input size.
2. **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time complexity - The number of steps grows slowly as the input size increases.
3. **O(n)**: Linear time complexity - The algorithm takes a linear amount of time proportional to the input size.
4. **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time complexity - A combination of linear and logarithmic growth rates.
5. **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time complexity - The algorithm's performance worsens rapidly with increasing input size.
6. **O(2^n)**: Exponential time complexity - The algorithm takes an enormous amount of time as the input size
grows.

**Real-world examples**

1. A search function in a database (e.g., Google search) typically has a O(log n) or O(n) complexity, depending on
how it's implemented.
2. Sorting algorithms like Quicksort have a O(n log n) complexity, making them efficient for large datasets.
3. Bubble sort is an example of an algorithm with a poor O(n^2) complexity.

**Why does Big O notation matter?**

Big O notation helps you:

1. **Predict performance**: Estimate how well your code will perform under different input sizes.
2. **Compare algorithms**: Choose the most efficient solution for a given problem.
3. **Optimize**: Focus on improving the algorithm's complexity when faced with performance issues.

In summary, Big O notation is a mathematical concept that measures an algorithm's complexity in terms of its
execution time relative to input size. Understanding Big O notation helps you write more efficient code and make
informed design decisions for your projects.
